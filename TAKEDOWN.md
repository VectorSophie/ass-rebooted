After getting a DMCA takedown notice for "The Color Code: Commandline Edition", the next natural step was to get one for "The 5 Love Languages".
So after receiving a takedown notice in my e-mail today (Nov 6th 2012), I've modified the test such that it does not directly provide copyrighted material from the 5 Love Languages test.
